# React-Native-Albums-Scroller

This is the final product of the first Udemy Complete React-Native and Redux Course. I'm learning react-native to be prepared for the Reactathon coming in March and just wanted to push a completed project up to GitHub.

This project shows how to set up a react-native enviroment, make an http request, and use the JSON to populate React Components. Also some styling and button logic.
